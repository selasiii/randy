# Randy Bot üêçüí∏
**Randy** is an experimental Forex scalping bot built in Python that executes a dual trade (Buy + Sell) at the open of every 1-minute candle. It uses a tight stop loss to catch sharp directional moves, and if one trade wins, it enters a series of anti-martingale trades in the winning direction using exponential lot sizes.

## üß™ Roadmap

* [ ] Implement anti-martingale spacing & lot sizing
* [ ] Breakeven & trailing stop logic
* [ ] Toggleable strategy filters
* [ ] MT5 trading statistics logging
* [ ] GUI frontend (optional)

## TASK LIST

Here's a **clear and actionable developer task list** to build out the full Randy forex trading bot in stages. We'll follow a modular development roadmap so each step is focused, testable, and builds on the last.

---

### ‚úÖ PHASE 1: Basic Trade Execution

**Goal:** Set up Randy to detect new 1-minute candles and place Buy + Sell orders.

* [x] **Initialize MT5 connection**
* [x] **Detect new M1 candles**
* [x] **Place Buy + Sell orders with tight SL**
* [x] **Log trade actions to console/log file**
* [x] ‚úÖ Finalize `main.py`, `candle_handler.py`, `order_executor.py`

---

### üîÅ PHASE 2: Anti-Martingale Logic

**Goal:** Add reaction logic once SL is hit to scale into the winning direction.

* [x] Detect which initial trade was stopped out
* [x] Begin placing exponentially larger trades in the winning direction
* [x] Implement pip-based spacing between anti-martingale entries
* [x] Limit number of anti-martingale trades (`max_trades`)
* [x] Finalize `trade_manager.py`

---

### üõ° PHASE 3: Breakeven and Trailing SL

**Goal:** Lock in profits intelligently and exit safely.

* [ ] Move SL to breakeven after `X` pips
* [ ] Enable trailing SL after `Y` pips
* [ ] Finalize dynamic SL logic inside `trade_manager.py`

---

### üìä PHASE 4: Risk Management

**Goal:** Protect capital and control exposure.

* [ ] Implement max daily loss / profit logic
* [ ] Halt trading after hitting limits
* [ ] SL-based trade invalidation logic (if gap or slippage exceeds tolerance)
* [ ] Finalize `risk_manager.py`

---

### üéØ PHASE 5: Optional Strategy Filters

**Goal:** Add toggleable confluence checks to improve signal quality.

* [ ] Directional bias filter (e.g., EMA 20 > EMA 50 = bullish bias)
* [ ] Multi-timeframe trend alignment (M1 aligned with M5 or M15)
* [ ] Choppy market filter using ATR or Bollinger Band width
* [ ] Add all strategy toggles to `config.py`
* [ ] Finalize `filters.py`

---

### üìÅ PHASE 6: Logging & Utilities

**Goal:** Ensure logging, tracking, and reusable MT5 helpers.

* [ ] Log trades, SL/TP, and bot events to `logs/trade_log.txt`
* [ ] Create helper functions in `mt5_utils.py` (e.g., get\_price, get\_point, check\_open\_orders)
* [ ] Finalize `logger.py` and `mt5_utils.py`

---

### üñ• PHASE 7: Optional GUI / Dashboard (stretch goal)

**Goal:** Add a visual dashboard or control panel.

* [ ] Show open trades, lot progression, current P/L
* [ ] Manual toggle to pause/resume bot
* [ ] Export trade history

---

### üß™ PHASE 8: Testing & Optimization

**Goal:** Backtest and optimize the bot under various conditions.

* [ ] Backtest core logic on historical data
* [ ] Optimize SL, pip spacing, breakeven, trailing SL
* [ ] Stress test with volatile pairs
* [ ] Prepare checklist for going live

---

### üîö FINAL PHASE: Deployment

**Goal:** Package and deploy the bot for daily execution.

* [ ] Create `.env` or secure config for credentials
* [ ] Add startup and restart logic
* [ ] (Optional) Integrate Telegram alerts or error notifications
